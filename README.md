# Kernel Craft

<img align="left" src="images/kernelcraft.png" alt="KernelCraft Project Illustration" width="200"/>

KernelCraft is an exciting journey into the hidden world of computers. Just like
explorers of the past, we set out to discover the secrets inside the heart of
modern systemsâ€”the kernel. This project will build a custom Linux kernel, create
a root filesystem using Buildroot, and use QEMU to test and experiment with new
device drivers.

Our mission is to understand how virtual devices, block drivers, and Virtio work
together to make everything function. Through each experiment, we will learn step
by step how these parts come alive, shaping the way computers communicate with the
world.

Join us in this adventure, where knowledge is gained through hands-on exploration,
and the world of technology becomes our playground.

# Steps

## Build the system

### build the linux kernel
```bash
mkdir linux/build
cp linux-config linux/build/.config
cd linux/
make O=build oldconfig
make O=build -j 8
```
### build qemu
```bash
mkdir qemu/build
cd qemu/build
../configure --target-list=x86_64-softmmu
make -j 8
```

### build a rootfs using buildroot
- We use BusyBox as init system
- Buildroot already puts everything in `output/`
```bash
cp buildroot-config buildroot/.config
cd buildroot
make oldconfig
make
```

## Boot the system

If you followed the steps in the [build section](https://github.com/gthvn1/kernelcraft#build) you should be able to boot
the kernel using `boot.ml` (or `boot.sh`).

```bash
./qemu/build/qemu-system-x86_64 \
    -enable-kvm \
    -cpu host \
    -kernel linux/build/arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage \
    -append "console=ttyS0  root=/dev/vda devtmpfs.mount=1" \
    -drive format=raw,file=buildroot/output/images/rootfs.ext2,if=virtio \
    -m 1024M
```

## Build a hello world kernel module
**TODO**

## Create a new block device in qemu
**TODO**

## Create the linux driver for the new qemu device
**TODO**

# Notes

- We provide an OCaml script just for fun but you can use `boot.sh`
    - to format ocaml file `ocamlformat -i <file.ml>`
- We are using a fork of linux, qemu and buildroot. We are on the master branch
but not uptodate. Check our repo to see SHA1.
- **linux** and **buildroot** are using Kconfig so both can be configured using `make menuconfig`
    - See `steps`
- **qemu** is configured to only build x86_64.
    - See `steps`

## Status

- Currently we are able to boot and get a prompt on serial
- Next step, add a kernel module.
